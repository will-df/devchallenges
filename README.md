<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

I started coding solutions to the challenges on [Devchallenges.io](http://devchallenges.io) and the different repositories were cluttering my github. That's why I decided to move to a unique repository. Below I write about each dev challenges individually

## 404 page

![screenshot](documentation/404.png)

The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to create a responsive 404 page. I did it completely by hand, no css generator used.

I learnt to use the flexbox in this experience to make the page responsive and change layout under 600px of width. Also, it's the first time that I used google fonts and learnt that you need to link them before invoking them in your css.

### Built With

- HTML 5
- CSS

### Features

- The page changes layout when the screen width is below/above 600px

### Acknowledgements

## Interior Design

The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/Jymh2b2FyebRTUljkNcb) was to create an interior design responsive page with a navigator menu. I did it completely by hand, no css generator used.

It was an interesting experience to create a full screen menu in the mobile version. I made it with a small drop down animation.
First usage of material icons too, very powerful palette.

### Built With

- HTML 5
- CSS
- Plain old javascript

### Features

- The page changes layout when the screen width is below/above 600px
- Under 600 px of screen width, the menu is substituted by an hamburger button that opens a full screen overlay with the navigation links

## Team Page

![screenshot](documentation/teampage.png)

The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/hhmesazsqgKXrTkYkt0U) was to create a responsive team page. I did it completely by hand, no css generator used.

I wanted to use the grid display because I wanted to get some experience with it and I must say it did well the job. Playing with media selectors and position CSS attributes allowed for easy configuration of the member mugshots to be moved down.

### Built With

- HTML 5
- CSS

### Features

- The page changes layout when the screen width is below/above 600px
- Under 600 px of screen width, images become 2 per row

## Recipe Page

![screenshot](documentation/recipepage.png)

The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/TtUjDt19eIHxNQ4n5jps) was to create a responsive recipe page. This time I started using Sass to organize better my css files. I wrote the html and sass files by hand

It's been a relatively long page to build, I had to experiment a lot with css for the small info box with cooking time, number of portions etc.
Also for the first time I did a custom numbered list (you'll find a good article on how to in the Acknowledgements section).

### Built With

- HTML 5
- CSS
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### Features

- The page changes layout when the screen width is below/above 600px
- The info box with cooking time, number of portions etc. sticks when scrolling down in the desktop layout

### Acknowledgements

- [Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/custom-list-number-styling/) for the interesting article on how to create custom ordered lists
